When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository keeps your work in a central location where you access it from other
computers. It is also a backup, so if you lose a hard drive on your local, you don't 
have to lose all of your work. Lastly, it provides a central location where others you
are working with can go to see the latest version and publish their own changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to specify when to pull changes manually because you might be working in
a branch and collaborating with someone, and you don't want to pull the other person's changes
until you're finished with your own. How does git deal with changes made to a single branch that
might conflict with each other?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You fork a whole repository on git hub if you want to start with the base of someone else's
code, but want to make your own version and give credeit to the person who made the original.
You clone a repository when you want to work on the repository locally. You create a branch when you want
to make changes that are experimental, such as a bug fix or new feature, without messing
with the production code or stable version. They are really each totally different concepts,
and it doesn't seem like they should be used interchangeably.
